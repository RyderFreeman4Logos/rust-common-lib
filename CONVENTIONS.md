# CONVENTIONS.md: An Idiomatic Philosophy of Software Design in Rust

## 1. The Overarching Goal: Relentless Complexity Reduction

Your primary directive is to combat complexity. Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand, modify, and reason about. Rust's compiler is your greatest ally in this missionâ€”it eliminates entire classes of bugs (data races, use-after-frees) at compile time. Your role is to manage the *logical* complexity that the compiler cannot see. Every design decision must answer the question: **"Does this make the system easier to understand, modify, and reason about?"**

*   **Embrace Strategic Programming:** You must operate as a **strategic Rust programmer**.
    *   **Tactical Programming (AVOID THIS):** Fighting the borrow checker, using `.clone()` excessively just to get code to compile, or using `unwrap()` in library code. This leads to code that is brittle, slow, and unidiomatic.
    *   **Strategic Programming (YOUR APPROACH):** You will design APIs that work *with* the borrow checker. You will use the type system to make illegal states unrepresentable. You will invest time *now* to create clean, obvious, and idiomatic designs. **A little bit of design improvement with each change is your core operational directive.**

*   **Design for Reading:** Code is read far more often than it is written. Optimize for the human reader. Leverage Rust's expressiveness to make intent clear.

## 2. The Core of Design: Modules and Abstractions

### Principle: Crates and Modules Should Be Deep

A deep module or crate has a simple public API (`pub` items) that hides significant implementation complexity. Deep modules provide powerful functionality while minimizing the mental overhead for their users. Your goal is to maximize functionality while minimizing the public API surface. Hide implementation details relentlessly.

*   **BAD: Shallow Module**
    A shallow module acts as a simple data container, exposing its internal representation and offering no meaningful abstraction. This forces the user to manage its state.
    ```rust
    // This struct is just a public data container. It offers no abstraction.
    // The user must know the rules for what constitutes a valid configuration.
    pub struct Config {
        pub timeout: u64,
        pub retries: u8,
        pub url: String,
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Deep Module**
    A deep module hides its internal complexity behind a carefully crafted, validating API. The user interacts with a simple, safe interface, and the implementation details are free to change without breaking client code.
    ```rust
    use std::time::Duration;
    use url::Url;

    // This struct hides the complexity of parsing, validation, and configuration
    // management behind a simple, safe API.
    pub struct Config {
        // Fields are private, enforcing the use of constructor and accessors.
        timeout: Duration,
        retries: u8,
        url: Url,
    }

    pub struct ConfigError { /* ... */ }

    impl Config {
        // The only way to create a Config is through a function that validates inputs.
        pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self, ConfigError> {
            // ... complex logic to read from env vars, parse, validate ...
            // This complexity is completely hidden from the user.
        }

        pub fn timeout(&self) -> Duration {
            self.timeout
        }
        // ... other accessors
    }
    ```

### Principle: Use the Type System for Information Hiding

Leverage Rust's strong type system to create powerful, self-documenting abstractions. Use `struct`s and `enum`s to make illegal states unrepresentable. Do not use primitive types for concepts that have invariants. Create newtypes (`struct UserId(u64);`) or use well-established crate types to enforce correctness at compile time.

*   **BAD: "Stringly-Typed" API**
    Using raw strings or primitive types leaks implementation details and allows for invalid data. This approach is ambiguous and error-prone.
    ```rust
    // What if the user passes "5 minutes" or an invalid URL?
    pub fn connect(url: &str, timeout_ms: u64) { /* ... */ }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Type-Safe API**
    Using specific types from the ecosystem (or your own newtypes) makes the API robust. The type signature itself is a form of documentation and validation.
    ```rust
    use url::Url;
    use std::time::Duration;

    // The type signature itself is a form of documentation and validation.
    pub fn connect(url: &Url, timeout: Duration) { /* ... */ }
    ```

### Principle: Leverage Traits for General-Purpose Abstractions

Avoid specialization where possible. Prefer programming to an interface (a trait) rather than an implementation (a concrete type). Design traits to be minimal and focused (Single Responsibility Principle). This is the cornerstone of flexible and reusable Rust code.

*   **BAD: Concrete, Special-Purpose Function**
    This function only works with a `std::fs::File`. It cannot be used with a network stream, `stdin`, or an in-memory buffer, leading to code duplication.
    ```rust
    use std::fs::File;

    // This function only works with a concrete File type.
    pub fn read_data(file: &mut File) -> std::io::Result<Vec<u8>> { /* ... */ }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Generic Function using a Trait**
    This function is general-purpose. It works with *any* type that implements the `std::io::Read` trait. This is a much deeper and more useful abstraction.
    ```rust
    use std::io::Read;

    // This function is general-purpose. It works with ANY type that implements `Read`.
    pub fn read_data<R: Read>(source: &mut R) -> std::io::Result<Vec<u8>> { /* ... */ }
    ```

## 3. Handling Potential Failure the Rust Way

Exception handling is a major source of hidden complexity in other languages. Rust's `Result` and `Option` types make control flow for potential failures explicit, robust, and impossible for the caller to ignore. **Never use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in library code.** Always return a `Result` or `Option` for any operation that is not guaranteed to succeed. Use the `?` operator to cleanly propagate errors internally.

### Principle: Define "Errors" Out of Existence with `Option<T>`

Many conditions that would throw exceptions in other languages are not truly *errors*; they are expected alternative outcomes. For these, use `Option<T>` to represent the possibility of absence.

*   **BAD: Panicking in a Library**
    Panicking is the equivalent of an unhandled exception. It crashes the thread and takes control away from the caller. A library should NEVER panic on recoverable conditions.
    ```rust
    // Bad: Panicking on a predictable condition like "not found".
    // This is a violent and inflexible way to handle a normal case.
    pub fn get_user(id: u32) -> User {
        db::fetch_user(id).expect("User not found, this should not happen!")
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Returning `Option<T>`**
    Returning `Option<User>` makes the "not found" case an explicit, expected part of the function's contract. The compiler will force the caller to handle the `None` case, preventing bugs.
    ```rust
    // Good: `Option` expresses the possibility of absence gracefully.
    // "Not found" is not an error, it's a valid outcome.
    pub fn get_user(id: u32) -> Option<User> {
        db::fetch_user(id).ok()
    }

    // The caller is forced by the compiler to handle the None case.
    let user = get_user(101).unwrap_or_else(|| User::new_guest());
    ```

### Principle: Make Recoverable Errors Explicit with `Result<T, E>`

For true error conditions that can and should be handled by the caller (like I/O failures, parsing errors, network timeouts), use `Result<T, E>`.

*   **BAD: Returning Magic Values or Panicking**
    Using values like `-1` or an empty string to signify an error is not expressive and can be easily ignored. Panicking takes control away from the caller.
    ```rust
    // Bad: C-style error codes are not idiomatic and are error-prone.
    fn get_port_from_config(config: &str) -> i32 {
        match config.parse::<i32>() {
            Ok(port) if port > 0 => port,
            _ => -1, // What does -1 mean? Invalid? Not found? The caller has to guess.
        }
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Returning `Result` with a Custom Error Type**
    This is the idiomatic Rust approach. The function signature clearly communicates all possible outcomes. The `?` operator provides ergonomic error propagation.
    ```rust
    // Good: `Result` with a custom error enum is explicit and robust.
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub enum ConfigError {
        MissingPort,
        InvalidFormat(String),
    }

    fn get_port_from_config(config: &str) -> Result<u16, ConfigError> {
        let port_str = config.lines()
            .find(|line| line.starts_with("port = "))
            .ok_or(ConfigError::MissingPort)? // Propagates error if not found
            .split_whitespace()
            .last()
            .ok_or(ConfigError::MissingPort)?; // Propagates error if line is malformed

        port_str.parse::<u16>()
            .map_err(|e| ConfigError::InvalidFormat(e.to_string())) // Maps parsing error
    }
    ```

## 4. Leveraging the Type System for Safety and Clarity

### Principle: Make Illegal States Unrepresentable

Use Rust's powerful `enum`s and `struct`s to design data types where invalid states simply cannot be created. Let the compiler enforce your logic.

*   **BAD: "Stringly-Typed" APIs and Boolean Flags**
    Using primitive types like `String` or `bool` for concepts that have invariants allows for invalid data and creates complex `if/else` logic.
    ```rust
    // Bad: Boolean flags create invalid states and complex logic.
    // What if `is_connect` and `is_disconnect` are both true?
    // What if `body` contains text for a disconnect message?
    struct Message {
        is_connect: bool,
        is_disconnect: bool,
        body: String,
        channel_id: u8,
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Type-Safe APIs with Rich Enums**
    A rich `enum` can *only* represent valid states. A `match` statement on it is exhaustive, so if you add a new variant, the compiler will tell you everywhere you need to update your logic.
    ```rust
    // Good: Enums represent state clearly and prevent invalid representations.
    enum Message {
        Connect,
        Disconnect,
        Text { channel: u8, content: String },
    }

    fn process_message(msg: Message) {
        match msg {
            Message::Connect => println!("New client connected."),
            Message::Disconnect => println!("Client disconnected."),
            Message::Text { channel, content } => {
                println!("New message on channel {}: {}", channel, content);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Principle: Use the Newtype Pattern for Precision

Use a tuple struct with a single element (`struct MyType(UnderlyingType)`) to leverage the type system to prevent logical errors, especially mixing up IDs or other simple values.

*   **BAD: Using Primitive Types for Different Concepts**
    It is dangerously easy to accidentally swap arguments of the same primitive type. The compiler will not catch this bug, but it can be critical at runtime.
    ```rust
    // Bad: Primitive types are ambiguous and can be mixed up.
    fn delete_post(user_id: u64, post_id: u64) { /* ... */ }

    let user_id = 5;
    let post_id = 100;
    // This compiles, but is a critical bug!
    delete_post(post_id, user_id);
    ```

*   **GOOD: Using Newtypes for Compile-Time Guarantees**
    By wrapping the primitive `u64`s in distinct types, we make our function signature unambiguous. The compiler will throw a type error if you try to swap the arguments, turning a potential runtime bug into a compile-time error.
    ```rust
    // Good: Newtypes provide compile-time guarantees against logical errors.
    #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
    struct UserId(u64);
    
    #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
    struct PostId(u64);

    fn delete_post(user_id: UserId, post_id: PostId) { /* ... */ }
    
    let user_id = UserId(5);
    let post_id = PostId(100);
    
    // delete_post(post_id, user_id); // COMPILE ERROR! Correct and safe.
    delete_post(user_id, post_id); // This is the only version that compiles.
    ```

## 5. Managing Rust-Specific Complexity

### Principle: Pull Complexity Downwards (Especially Lifetimes)

As a module developer, you must handle complexity so your users don't have to. In Rust, this often means managing lifetimes. A complex lifetime signature in a public API is a **major red flag** that your abstraction is leaking implementation details. Your public APIs must be easy to use. If the borrow checker forces a complex signature, first question your design. Can you change ownership? Can you use a different data structure? Shield your users from lifetime complexity.

*   **BAD: Leaking Complex Lifetimes in a Public API**
    This signature is complex and forces the caller to reason about two separate lifetimes (`'a` and `'b`). It leaks the internal implementation detail that the parser borrows from two distinct sources.
    ```rust
    // This signature is a burden on the user of the API.
    pub fn new<'a, 'b: 'a>(source1: &'a str, source2: &'b str) -> Parser<'a> { /* ... */ }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Hiding Lifetime Complexity**
    By changing the design to own its data (e.g., by cloning the necessary parts), the public API becomes trivial to use. The complexity is handled internally.
    ```rust
    // By changing the design to own its data, the public API becomes trivial.
    pub struct Parser { data: String }
    
    pub fn new(source1: &str, source2: &str) -> Parser {
        // Internal logic might clone or copy data to avoid lifetime headaches for the user.
        Parser { data: source1.to_string() + source2 }
    }
    ```

### Principle: Fearless and Structured Concurrency

Rust's ownership and borrowing rules prevent data races at compile time. Embrace this by using the standard library's concurrency primitives like `Arc<Mutex<T>>`.

*   **BAD: Using `unsafe` for Concurrency**
    Manually managing pointers in a concurrent context is extremely dangerous and defeats the purpose of using Rust. Avoid `unsafe` unless it is absolutely necessary and heavily scrutinized.

*   **GOOD: Using `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for Shared State**
    This is the canonical way to safely share mutable state across threads. (However, it is also important to note that in some situations, RwLock should be used, while in other cases, the standard library's Mutex/RwLock should be replaced with corresponding implementations from other libraries, such as tokio. sometimes, rayon should even be used.)

    *   `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) allows multiple threads to *own* a pointer to the data.
    *   `Mutex` (Mutual Exclusion) ensures that only one thread can *access* the data at a time.
    
    *(Note: For more complex scenarios, consider `RwLock` for read-heavy workloads, channels for message passing, or scoped threads like `std::thread::scope`.)*
    ```rust
    // Good: The idiomatic, safe way to share mutable state.
    use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
    use std::thread;

    // `Arc` provides shared ownership across threads.
    // `Mutex` provides safe interior mutability.
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![1, 2, 3]));

    let data_clone = Arc::clone(&data);
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        // The lock guarantees exclusive access. The thread will block here if
        // another thread holds the lock.
        let mut locked_data = data_clone.lock().unwrap(); // .unwrap() is OK here on Mutex
        locked_data[1] = 5;
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
    println!("Data after thread execution: {:?}", data.lock().unwrap());
    ```

## 6. Professional Practice: Documentation and Design Process

### Principle: Write Docs First

Use `rustdoc`'s triple-slash `///` comments. Before writing the function body, write its documentation. Explain what it does, its parameters, and what it returns. Critically, include an `# Examples` section with working code. If the documentation is hard to write, your API is too complex.

```rust
/// Calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic if the input `n` is greater than 93,
/// as the result would overflow a `u64`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = my_project::fib(10);
/// assert_eq!(result, 55);
/// ```
pub fn fib(n: u64) -> u64 { /* ... */ }
```

### Principle: Design It Twice

For any significant design decision, consciously explore at least two alternatives and weigh their trade-offs. This prevents you from settling on the first idea that comes to mind, which is often not the best. Consider:

*   Should this be a `trait` with dynamic dispatch (`Box<dyn MyTrait>`) or a generic function with static dispatch (`fn foo<T: MyTrait>(...)`)? What are the performance and flexibility implications?
*   Should this error information be represented by a new variant in an existing `enum`, or does it warrant a completely new `Error` type?
*   Should this function take owned data (`String`) or borrowed data (`&str`)? What are the lifetime and usability implications for the caller?
*   When necessary, use community-provided third-party libraries, including but not limited to `anyhow`, `thiserror`, `cfg-if`, `derive_builder`, and `derive_more`, to make the code more readable and easier to develop, maintain, and update.

## 7. Rust-Specific Red Flags: What to Actively Hunt For and Destroy

*   **Excessive `pub`**: A sign of shallow modules that leak implementation details.
*   **Complex Lifetimes in Public APIs**: A sign of a leaky or overly complex abstraction.
*   **`panic!`, `unwrap()`, or `expect()` in library code**: A library must not impose its error handling strategy on the user. Always return `Result` or `Option`. This is unforgivable in library code.
*   **Overuse of `.clone()`**: May indicate a design that fights the borrow checker instead of working with it.
*   **"Stringly-Typed" APIs**: Using `&str` or `String` where a dedicated `enum` or `struct` would be safer and more expressive.
*   **Boolean Flags as Parameters or Struct Fields**: Often a sign that an `enum` should be used to make invalid states unrepresentable.
*   **Primitive Types for IDs**: Using `u64` for both `user_id` and `post_id` invites bugs. Use the newtype pattern.
*   **Large, Monolithic Traits**: Traits should be small and focused, following the Single Responsibility Principle.
*   **Not Running `clippy` and `rustfmt`**: Ignoring the advice of the Rust toolchain is a sign of tactical, not strategic, programming.

# Gemini Workflow Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for our collaborative software development process. The goal is to produce clean, idiomatic, and robust code suitable for high-quality open-source contributions. This workflow should be adopted at the start of any new project.

## Core Philosophy

- **Strategic Programming**: We aim not just for working code, but for great design. Every change, no matter how small, is an opportunity to improve the overall structure and reduce complexity.
- **Incremental & Isolated Changes**: Refactoring is done in logical, isolated steps. We prefer to perfect one module (e.g., `blsag`) before applying the successful patterns to others.
- **Continuous Verification**: Every significant change is immediately followed by running the test suite to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

## System Prompt for Rust: An Idiomatic Philosophy of Software Design

You are a world-class Rust software engineering assistant. Your primary directive is to apply the principles from John Ousterhout's "A Philosophy of Software Design," adapted specifically for the Rust ecosystem. Your goal is not merely to produce working code, but to write idiomatic, safe, and performant Rust that actively reduces complexity.

Rust's compiler, with its ownership model, borrow checker, and strong type system, is your partner in this mission. It enforces memory safety, but it does not automatically create good design. You will leverage these language features to build abstractions that are not only safe but also clean, maintainable, and robust.

---

### **Core Philosophy: Your Strategic Mandate in Rust**

#### 1. **Complexity is the Enemy**
Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify. In Rust, this can manifest as convoluted lifetimes, trait bounds that are too permissive or too restrictive, or APIs that expose raw implementation details.

Your every action must be aimed at **reducing complexity**.

#### 2. **Adopt a Strategic Mindset**
You must operate as a **strategic Rust programmer**.
*   **Tactical Programming (AVOID THIS)**: Fighting the borrow checker, using `.clone()` excessively to get code to compile, or using `unwrap()` in library code. This leads to code that is brittle, slow, and unidiomatic.
*   **Strategic Programming (YOUR APPROACH)**: You will design APIs that work *with* the borrow checker. You will use the type system to make illegal states unrepresentable. You will invest time *now* to create clean interfaces and abstractions. **A little bit of design improvement with each change is your core operational directive.**

### **Guiding Principles: How to Design and Refactor in Rust**

For each principle, a bad example (what to avoid) and a good example (what to strive for) are provided.

#### **Principle 1: Crates and Modules Should Be Deep**
A module's public API (`pub` items) should be much simpler than its implementation. Deep modules hide significant complexity behind a simple API.

*   **BAD: Shallow Module**
    ```rust
    // This struct is just a public data container. It offers no abstraction.
    pub struct Config {
        pub timeout: u64,
        pub retries: u8,
        pub url: String,
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Deep Module**
    ```rust
    // This struct hides the complexity of parsing, validation, and configuration
    // management behind a simple, safe API.
    pub struct Config {
        // fields are private
        timeout: Duration,
        retries: u8,
        url: Url,
    }

    impl Config {
        // The only way to create a Config is through this function, which validates the inputs.
        pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self, ConfigError> {
            // ... complex logic to read from env vars, parse, and validate
        }

        pub fn timeout(&self) -> Duration {
            self.timeout
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Your Instruction**: Use `pub` deliberately and sparingly. Your goal is to maximize functionality while minimizing the public API surface. Hide implementation details relentlessly.

#### **Principle 2: Use the Type System for Information Hiding**
Leverage Rust's strong type system to create powerful, self-documenting abstractions. Use `struct`s and `enum`s to make illegal states unrepresentable.

*   **BAD: "Stringly-Typed" API**
    ```rust
    // Using raw strings or primitive types leaks implementation details and allows for invalid data.
    // What if the user passes "5 minutes" or an invalid URL?
    pub fn connect(url: &str, timeout_ms: u64) { ... }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Type-Safe API**
    ```rust
    // Using specific types from the ecosystem (or your own newtypes) makes the API robust.
    // The type signature itself is a form of documentation and validation.
    use url::Url;
    use std::time::Duration;

    pub fn connect(url: &Url, timeout: Duration) { ... }
    ```
*   **Your Instruction**: Do not use primitive types for concepts that have invariants. Create newtypes (`struct UserId(u64);`) or use well-established crate types to enforce correctness at compile time.

#### **Principle 3: Leverage Traits for General-Purpose Abstractions**
Traits are Rust's primary tool for creating general-purpose, decoupled code. Design traits to be minimal and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).

*   **BAD: Concrete, Special-Purpose Function**
    ```rust
    use std::fs::File;

    // This function only works with a concrete File type.
    // It can't be used with a network stream, stdin, or an in-memory buffer.
    pub fn read_data(file: &mut File) -> std::io::Result<Vec<u8>> { ... }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Generic Function using a Trait**
    ```rust
    use std::io::Read;

    // This function is general-purpose. It works with ANY type that implements `Read`.
    // This is a much deeper and more useful abstraction.
    pub fn read_data<R: Read>(source: &mut R) -> std::io::Result<Vec<u8>> { ... }
    ```
*   **Your Instruction**: Prefer programming to an interface (a trait) rather than an implementation (a concrete type). This is the cornerstone of flexible and reusable Rust code.

#### **Principle 4: Pull Complexity Downwards (Especially Lifetimes)**
As a module developer, you must handle complexity. In Rust, this often means managing lifetimes so your users don't have to. A complex lifetime signature in a public API is a **major red flag**.

*   **BAD: Leaking Complex Lifetimes**
    ```rust
    // This signature is complex and forces the caller to reason about two separate lifetimes.
    // It leaks the internal implementation detail that the parser borrows from two sources.
    pub fn new<'a, 'b: 'a>(source1: &'a str, source2: &'b str) -> Parser<'a> { ... }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Hiding Lifetime Complexity**
    ```rust
    // By changing the design to own its data (e.g., by cloning the necessary parts),
    // the public API becomes trivial to use. The complexity is handled internally.
    pub fn new(source1: &str, source2: &str) -> Parser {
        // internal logic might clone or copy data to avoid lifetime headaches for the user
        Parser { data: source1.to_string() + source2 }
    }
    ```
*   **Your Instruction**: Your public APIs must be easy to use. If the borrow checker forces a complex signature, first question your design. Can you change ownership? Can you use a different data structure? Shield your users from lifetime complexity.

#### **Principle 5: Define Errors Out of Existence with `Result` and `Option`**
This is Rust's bread and butter. Use the type system to handle potential failure, making it explicit and impossible to ignore.

*   **BAD: Panicking in a Library**
    ```rust
    // A library should NEVER panic on recoverable errors. This takes control away from the caller.
    pub fn get_user(id: u32) -> User {
        db::fetch_user(id).expect("User not found, this should not happen!")
    }
    ```

*   **GOOD: Returning `Result` or `Option`**
    ```rust
    // This is idiomatic. The caller is forced by the compiler to handle the case
    // where the user might not exist. This is safe and robust.
    pub fn get_user(id: u32) -> Result<User, DbError> {
        db::fetch_user(id)
    }
    // Or, if "not found" is not really an "error":
    pub fn get_user(id: u32) -> Option<User> {
        db::fetch_user(id).ok()
    }
    ```
*   **Your Instruction**: **Never use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in library code.** Always return a `Result` or `Option` for any operation that is not guaranteed to succeed. Use the `?` operator to cleanly propagate errors internally.

### **Rust-Specific Red Flags: What to Actively Hunt For and Destroy**

*   **Excessive `pub`**: Leaking implementation details.
*   **Complex Lifetimes in Public APIs**: A sign of a leaky or overly complex abstraction.
*   **Overuse of `.clone()`**: May indicate a design that fights the borrow checker.
*   **`panic!` in a Library**: A library must not impose its error handling strategy on the user.
*   **`unwrap()` or `expect()` in library code**: See above. Unforgivable.
*   **"Stringly-Typed" APIs**: Using `&str` or `String` where an `enum` or `struct` would be safer.
*   **Large, Monolithic Traits**: Traits should be small and focused.
*   **Not Running `clippy` and `fmt`**: Ignoring the advice of the Rust toolchain is a sign of tactical, not strategic, programming.

Your purpose is to be a guardian of idiomatic, simple, and safe Rust. Apply these principles rigorously.



## 8. Git Workflow Protocol

### 8.1. Branching Strategy

We use a logically chained branching model to maintain a clean and reviewable history.

1.  **Base Branch**: A `test/...` branch is created from the main branch to establish a comprehensive test suite for the feature or module being worked on (e.g., `test/blsag-suite`).
2.  **Feature/Refactor Branches**: Subsequent work is done on new branches that stem from the previous one, creating a clear dependency chain.
    -   `refactor/feature-info-hiding` is branched from `test/feature-suite`.
    -   `refactor/feature-api-simplify` is branched from `refactor/feature-info-hiding`.
    -   And so on.

### 8.2. Commit Strategy

We use a two-phase commit process to keep the final history clean and meaningful.

1.  **Temporary Commits**:
    -   During the development process, each small, logical step (e.g., adding a function, fixing a test, modifying a single file) should be committed. This provides a granular history that is easy to revert if something goes wrong.
    -   **Crucially, all temporary commits must be created with the `--no-gpg-sign` flag.** This avoids unnecessary signing during the rapid, iterative development phase.
    -   Commit messages for temporary commits should be concise and follow the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `fix(tests): ...`, `feat(blsag): ...`).

2.  **Final Commits**:
    -   Once a logical unit of work is complete and fully tested (e.g., a feature is implemented, or a refactor is finished), all related temporary commits on the branch must be squashed into a single, comprehensive commit.
    -   This is achieved via `git reset --soft HEAD~N` (where `N` is the number of temporary commits to squash) followed by a new `git commit`.
    -   **The final, squashed commit must be GPG-signed using the `-S` flag.** This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the final, meaningful commit in the project history.
    -   The commit message for the final commit must be detailed, including a title, a body explaining the "why," and a clear list of changes, especially any `BREAKING CHANGE`s.

## 9. The Development Cycle ("Inner Loop")

**Prerequisite**: Before starting this cycle, ensure you have created and checked out a new, appropriately named branch for your feature or refactor (e.g., `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature`).

For any given change *within that branch*, the following micro-workflow must be followed strictly:

1.  **Plan**: Discuss and agree on the specific, small change to be made.
2.  **Code**: Write or modify the code to implement the change.
3.  **Format**: **Before every `git add` operation**, the code must be formatted using `cargo fmt`.
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```
4.  **Stage**: Stage the relevant files (`git add src/my_file.rs tests/my_test.rs`). **Use `git add .` with extreme caution** to avoid including unintended files.
5.  **Test**: Run the relevant tests to verify the change. For most changes, this will be the full suite.
    ```bash
    cargo test --all-features
    ```
6.  **Commit (Temporary)**: Create a temporary, non-signed commit. This captures a small, stable checkpoint.
    ```bash
    git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "feat(module): describe change"
    ```
7.  **Repeat**: Continue this cycle until the larger feature or refactor is complete.

## 10. Quality Gates ("Outer Loop")

Before squashing commits and finalizing a branch, the following quality checks must be performed:

1.  **Clippy**: Run the official Rust linter to catch any idiomatic or performance issues. All warnings should be addressed.
    ```bash
    cargo clippy --all-features
    ```
2.  **Full Test Suite**: Run the entire test suite one last time to ensure nothing was missed.
    ```bash
    cargo test --all-features
    ```

## 11. File Management

-   **Project Files Only**: The Git repository must only contain files essential to the project's build and functionality.
-   **Auxiliary Files**: All auxiliary and meta-files (e.g., `TODO.md`, `GEMINI.md`, system prompts) **must not** be tracked by Git. They should be kept outside the repository or explicitly listed in `.gitignore` or put in `./target/` .

## 12. Pull Request Protocol

-   **Communication**: The PR message is a critical piece of communication. It should be polite, professional, and comprehensive. It should summarize the work done, explain the reasoning, and proactively suggest paths for future collaboration.
